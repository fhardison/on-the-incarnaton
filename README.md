# On The Incarnation

This project's goal is to publish a digital transcription of _On the Incarnation_ by St. Athanasius of Alexandria.

The text was OCR'ed using [Tesseract OCR engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). It was then spell checked using [Titivillus](http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/fr/degemer-fr/actualites/368-the-classicist-s-spellchecker-v1-0) in Microsoft Word or the [Ancient Greek Spellchecker](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/ancientgreek) for LibreOffice before being put into a text file in the `text` folder. 

There may still be errors as each word has not been checked against the PDF, but the spell checkers have caught so many errors that I have not felt the need to look for more at present. Please report any you find.

This text is being prepared as part of the [Greek Learner Texts Project](https://greek-learner-texts.org/).

## Source

The scan of the of the text is [Migne vol 025.](http://patristica.net/graeca/#t025) found on pages 332-383 of the [Google Ebook](https://books.google.com/books?id=_A0RAAAAYAAJ) and `De Incarnatione Verbi.pdf` which is in the `orig` folder as it was much easier to read. (Thanks to Nathan Binns for finding a better scan of the text.)
