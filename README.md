# On The Incarnation

This project's goal is to publish a digital transcription of _On the Incarnation_ by St. Athanasius of Alexandria.

The text was OCR'ed using [gImage Reader](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gimagereader/) with the [Tesseract  OCR engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). It was then spell checked using [Titivillus](http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/fr/degemer-fr/actualites/368-the-classicist-s-spellchecker-v1-0) in Microsoft Word before being put into a text file in the `checked` folder. 

There may still be errors as each word has not been checked against the PDF, but the Titivillus spell checker has caught so many errors that I have not felt the need to look for more at present. Please report any you find.

This text is being prepared as part of the [Greek Learner Texts Project](https://greek-learner-texts.org/).
